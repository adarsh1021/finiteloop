            Seeking




            It is a space of intent. We engage with existing and new customers,
            giving them foundational ideas, and shaping new projects. We are
            constantly looking out for potential innovations where technology
            can help. In an engagement that is already on, it is the space
            before a new problem definition starts. The reason that keeps our
            journey interesting, as problem solvers. We seek. With great doubt,
            and great faith.
