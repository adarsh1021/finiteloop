Transforming

It is the space of transformation of the problem to a solution. It is a period of many deployments, and active user group engagement. A time where customer sees a complete solution. Stakeholders provide active feedback. Roll-out, go-live, deployments are some words we use here. All the way, we anticipate changes, and accommodate them gracefully.
