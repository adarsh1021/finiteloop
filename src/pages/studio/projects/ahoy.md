We worked with one of the largest ship fleet management companies in the world to create a mobile app for seafarers. The team put together our varied experiences to design for an unfamiliar user group and work environment, requiring a deep immersive study into the world of shipping. The app is a major component of ongoing learning and completion of tasks assigned to the Seafarers.
