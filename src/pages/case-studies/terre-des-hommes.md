We helped Terre des Hommes gain control of children data and help identify and nurture children’s needs while improving staff responsiveness and collaboration.

## **Focus**

- Digital transformation
- Definition of technology vision
- Salesforce implementation

## **Challenges**

When children were accomodated into homes, their details were entered into an MS Access based system, with a lot of duplicate/incomplete information. The files were stored on a single server, and the database could only be updated by 1 person at a time, due to file locking.

The data was not present in a single location, with even basic data requiring analysis of excel sheets and manual operations. There was a lot of paper based records holding review and health information and had to be manually read through. This was not practical to scale or maintain.

Most of the communication between the staff was either through direct contact, or via phones and emails. There was no scope for real/near real time group collaboration unless the staff were physically present in a single location.

Emails and excel sheets were the main repository of donor contact information and donation promises. There was no way to establish when a donor/partner was previously contacted, who contacted the donor and what was the result.

## **Solution**

FiniteLoop implemented three Salesforce based applications for helping TDH Core to regain control of data.

The TDH Core process app supported recording of children when they came into the organization, along with all contact details, their current situation and allowed for easy assignment to homes, based on the home’s ability to support children. This app provides a single place to gather all children data, right from Homes and projects that they are assigned to, right up to their health and education records. Specific highlights and needs can be easily captured and human workflows can be triggered and kept track of in the system.

The system provides a rich set of reports to identify issues in homes, children needing attention and lead track records.

The TDH Core Donation Management system allows for tracking donors, donor organizations and allow TDH staff to solicit funding and plan donation campaigns, outreach etc in a single place, while monitoring ongoing engagements.

Chatter was implemented to improve collaboration and real time communication within the staff groups.

A case management system was also implemented to track specific situations in the organisation or based on children’s needs

## **Benefits**

The TDH Core Salesforce implementation allows for real time data reporting, helping the senior staff during the everyday transaction needs with partners and other governmental organizations. With the help of a connected tablet, the senior staff now have access to information on demand.

Planning home capacities, tracking home performance and needs, tracking miscelleneous expenses allow for quality data required to support TDH Core’s petitions for funds.

Chatter guarantees information transmission and collaboration across the various staff groups in the organization, allowing for seamless and rich communication in real/near real time.

Donation campaigns can effectively target the real need and supported by real data.

Since everything is in the cloud, there is no need for investing in local servers, software and other miscellaneous dependencies, allowing TDH Core to focus on their main subject and provide the best for the children

## **Technology**

- Static code analysers
