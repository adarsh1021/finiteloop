The HR workflow and recruitment of fellows/candidates are in a semi-manual process with many overheads. FiniteLoop designed the process, architected the solution, created migration plan for existing data, and developed the solution.

## **Focus**

- Architecture and design
- Development of document management workflow
- Process mapping

## **Challenges**

- Manually creating and sending contracts to candidates for signing. In total, managing 16 different type of contract templates manually is time consuming, and prone to errors.
- Signed contracts and other documents are manually scanned and stored in a drive. Hence there is probability of the documents being misplaced.Very little security around the sensitive information shared by the candidates as all the documents are stored in a drive.
- Interview and Contract details are stored in a spread sheet. Hence it is impossible to automatically track all the information related to candidates, renew contracts on time without setting manual reminders.

## **Solution**

HR application which handles the recruitment process was developed for EWB.

Some of the salient features of the application include.

- Managing the interview process.
- Automatically creating contracts from templates using Conga Composer.
- Ability to send offers easily through DocuSign and get electronically signed contracts back in a way that are entirely automated and synced with Salesforce.
- Ability to track what key documents have been received through check lists (i.e. bank information, Contracts signed, medical information)
- All documents sent by the candidates via email are automatically stored in Salesforce application.
- Tasks created automatically at different steps in the process to remind the record owner about renewing contract or insurance policy based on contract end date.

## **Benefits**

- All the information related to candidates recruitment is stored in Salesforce, and with proper authorization the information is available anytime anywhere.
- Fully automated process of creating, sending and e-signing of contracts by the candidates.
- All documents sent by the candidates as part of the onboarding process are automatically synched with Salesforce.
- Automatic reminders enable record owners efficiently manage onboarding, off boarding or contract renewals of candidates.

- Docusign
